# Tribute Page for Symmetra

This was my first project for the FreeCodeCamp responsive web design certification. 
This webpage was created with HTML, CSS and flexbox. This page tells you about her
general information, abilities and some of her background. She is my favorite damage hero in overwatch.

To view this you can check out its Github Page or fork this repo to play around with it yourself.
